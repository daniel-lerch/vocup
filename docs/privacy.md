# Vocup Privacy Statement

## Data that Vocup collects

Vocup collects the following information for analytics:

- Anonymized IP address
- OS version
- Vocup version
- How often you open Vocup
- Usage statistics about specific features

This information is used to find out how our software is being used and to improve the application.
We process your data on an own server and will not share it with any other company.  

Your vocabulary books are only processed locally on your computer and never shared with us.

If you do not want to share statistics about your Vocup usage you can disable internet services in the settings.

### Technical details

We use a self hosted instance of the excellent [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) analytics software.
It is configured to remove the last byte of all IP addresses in order to anonymize them but still allow basic Geo IP locations.

## Third party services

### Microsoft Store

Vocup is distributed via the Microsoft Store which can collect crash reports and usage statistics to share them with the developers.
You configure this behaviour in the Windows settings. Vocup is not responsible for data that Microsoft collects.

### GitHub Releases

Vocup is also available as a .exe installer or portable .zip archive. These variants check for updates on every application start.
Your IP address and the version number of your Vocup app are transmitted to GitHub Inc. for this purpose.
